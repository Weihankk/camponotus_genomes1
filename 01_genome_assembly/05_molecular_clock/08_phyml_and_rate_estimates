# With the four-fold degenerate sites alignment of the four individuals, I estimated a model of sequence evolution using 
# jModelTest
# best model as decided by AIC = GTR + I

# Here, I used an unrooted four taxon user tree for use in PhyML to estimate branch lengths using the command:

phyml  -i _total_4d_sites.nex -d nt -q -m GTR -v e -u unrooted_tree.tre -o lr

# user tree info in step: 05_prepare_phylogeny.r

# next, to get a point estimate of the substitution rate in Camponotus, estimate the % divergence by the branch length in the tree
# and dividing that by the mean divergence time between Camponotus and Formica
# divergence times from input phylogeny (in millions of years): 81.1038 mya
# calculation = camponotus_branch_length / (divergence_times * 1e6)
# in r:
0.1609 / ( 81.1038 * 1e6 )
# camponotus output: 1.983877e-09 mutations / site / year
